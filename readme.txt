At last! Turnkey bbPress. Beautiful bbPress styles. Essential layout and user/admin usability options. No CSS or PHP coding required.

== Description ==

Finally, you can get a great looking bbPress site with just one plugin. No need for custom CSS or PHP programming. Turnkey bbPress! (Formerly named <em>Weaver for bbPress</em> by WeaverTheme.)

Get your bbPress site up and running with beautiful themed styling, plus all the essential layout and user/admin usability options needed to run a real world forum with **Turnkey bbPress**.

**Turnkey bbPress** was developed by the makers of the popular <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> WordPress theme, the *original* options based WP theme. If there's one thing we know, it's how to provide the features and options you need to build a great looking website. And now you can do that with a bbPress site.

We also know *bbPress* was designed to be lightweight and efficient, but that means that many features required to build and run a real-world forum are missing from the base *ppPress* plugin.

**Turnkey bbPress** makes it easy.

* **Inherited WP Theme Style**: The font family and link styles of your WordPress theme are used in the bbPress subTheme.

* **Forum Font Size**: Set the base font size for your forum. One setting to make font size larger or smaller to match your WP theme.

= Tweak Forum and Topic List Layout =

Hide various elements of Forum and Topic Lists.

* **Subforums in Columns**" Display Subforum in Columns rather than a comma separated list.

Each of these features can be enabled separately.

* **Mentions**: When a Participant is mentioned with an **@** in a post, they can be automatically notified by email.
* **Best Answer**: When enabled, allows topic author (or moderator) to mark one reply as the best answer. Displays status indicators when a question has been marked answered.
* **Private Replies**: Allows Participants to mark replies as Private - readable only by the Participant, the topic originator, and Moderators.
* **Profile Visibility**: Set global Profile Visibility, as well as allow Participants to set their own Profile as private.
* **View Counter**: Display counter to show how many times a topic has been viewed.
* **Create New Topic**: Add "Create New Topic" link at top right of Single Forum views.
* **Indicator Icons for Favorited and Subscribed**: Easy to see favorites and subscriptions.

**Turnkey bbPress** adds options that makes administering your bbPress Forum easier.

* **Visual Editor**: Enable the Visual Editor for creating topics and replies.

* **Site Email Address**: Allows you to override the From: and email address values for emails originating with your Forum.
* **Redirect Register/Lost Password**: Redirects wp-login.php and wp-signup.php attempts to a site specific Register/Password page.
* **Status Indicators**: Show status indicators for special topics and replies: Private Reply, Spam, Trash. End the confusion.
* **Profile Email Link**: Add a mailto: email link to user Profile. Make it easier for Moderators to send direct emails.
* **Auto Block Spam Authors**: Automatically Block Authors of topics or replies when marked as SPAM by Moderators.
* **Disable bbPress Moderation**: The new bbPress will automatically and silently mark new posts and replies as Pending depending on the results of a new moderation system. This will disable that.

= Compatibility with Other bbPress Plugins =

There are other excellent plugins available that can add more essential features to a *bbPress* Forum. Unfortunately, sometimes they add features that don't including styling that matches the rest of your forum, or doesn't work will with some WP Themes. We've added integrated styling support for other plugins.

* **bbPress Pencil Unread**: We think the ability to know if posts have been read or not is essential. **Turnkey bbPress** adds color matched Unread indicators and makes the "Mark Unread" link a theme matched button at the top of forum lists.


= The essentials, all in one =

The developer of this plugin also created the original and best options based WordPress theme: Weaver Xtreme. Weaver Xtreme has its own bbPress based support forum. In the process of running the support forum, we've found that the features included in this plugin are really essential for running a truly vibrant forum, especially one used for technical support.

**Turnkey bbPress** is small and efficient. Options are only loaded and used if individually enabled. No unnecessary code bloat!


= Great Support =

We do not support **Turnkey bbPress** on the default WordPress Support Forum. Instead, we support it only on our own *bbPress* based forum: [Weaver Support Forum](//forum.weavertheme.com).

It is easy to get started with **Turnkey bbPress**. Get more documentation at [Turnkey bbPress Guide](//guide.weavertheme.com/category/weaver-for-bbpress/).

= Automated Installation =

== Other Notes ==
